# Dan-Kopac-Module-2-Challenge

This weeks challenge was tough for me. I still couldnt get my pictures to respond to link to websites nor was I able to get the Navbar to move with the scroller. However the website is user friendly aside from those things.

Had to use help from youtube videos to help me out this week as i was heavily confused on what i was doing wrong

Alot of my code came from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX3ikOsQg58

half of the pictures used in were mine others used from websites used as placeholders for now because i am new to the web development world.
